# 🤖 ML-Powered Tic Tac Toe | AI vs Human + Minimax Analyzer

An interactive Tic Tac Toe game where a machine learning model plays against a human—and every move is evaluated by a Minimax algorithm to see if it's optimal.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Human (X) vs AI (O) gameplay  
- 🧠 AI decisions are made using a TensorFlow/Keras-trained model  
- 🔍 AI moves are evaluated by the Minimax algorithm to check for optimality  

### 📊 Real-time analytics:

- 📈 Player and AI win probabilities (updated dynamically)  
- 🤔 Indicator showing whether the AI’s move was optimal  
- 📝 If the AI makes a suboptimal move, Minimax suggests better ones in the log window  
- 🔁 Restart button to reset the game anytime  
- 🧪 Displays training dataset size in the window title

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (for GUI)  
- NumPy  
- TensorFlow / Keras (for training and inference)  
- Recursive Minimax algorithm (for game theory comparison)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to provide not only a fun way to play Tic Tac Toe, but also a deeper understanding of how **machine learning** and **game theory** interact.

By comparing the AI's move with Minimax's optimal move, you can:

- 🔬 Learn how ML models behave in strategic, turn-based games  
- 🧩 See when and why an AI might make mistakes  
- 🛠️ Gain insights into model reasoning and limitations

## 💡 Ideal For

- Beginners exploring **ML vs classic algorithms**  
- Students learning **Minimax** and game evaluation  
- Developers building **AI-assisted games** or tools
