🤖 ML-Powered Tic Tac Toe | AI vs Human + Minimax Analyzer

🚀 Features /n
✅ Human (X) vs AI (O) gameplay
🧠 AI decisions are made using a TensorFlow/Keras-trained model
🔍 AI moves are evaluated by the Minimax algorithm to check for optimality

📊 Real-time analytics:
Player and AI win probabilities
Indication of whether the AI's move was optimal
📝 If the AI makes a suboptimal move, Minimax suggests the best alternatives, displayed in the log box
🔁 Restart button to reset the game anytime
🧪 Displays training dataset size in the window title

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Tkinter (for GUI)
NumPy
TensorFlow / Keras (for training the AI model)
Recursive Minimax algorithm for move validation

🎯 Purpose
This project aims to provide not only a fun way to play Tic Tac Toe, but also a deeper look into how AI and game theory interact. By comparing ML predictions with Minimax decisions, you gain insight into the model’s reasoning—and learn when and why it might go wrong.

Ideal for:
Learning how ML models behave in strategic games
Understanding Minimax in action
Evaluating AI decisions in a controlled environment
